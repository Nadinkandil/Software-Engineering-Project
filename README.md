## 🧠 Project Description
CodeTrack is coding learning platform that aims to develop a user-friendly and customizable coding learning platform to address challenges faced by learners. Current platforms often have complex interfaces, limited engagement, and lack personalization. Our solution will offer:
- Multiple programming languages and learning tracks
- Simplified lessons for diverse learning styles
- Intuitive user interface for all skill levels, including beginners
- Progress tracking tools to keep learners motivated
- Gamified features and rewards to enhance engagement
- Regular content updates to stay current
- Scalable backend systems for performance as the user base grows

The goal is to make coding learning accessible, enjoyable, and effective, keeping learners motivated and on track to achieve their goals.
